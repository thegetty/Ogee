# Ogee
Ogee Arches is a package designed for the Arches platform that implements the Linked.art data model, provides a complete vocabulary to support that data model and is fully documented with reusable documentation.

Ogee Arches has been created by Getty Digital with the support of Takin.solutions. Its primary aim is to serve as a starter Arches package for projects aiming to use the Linked.art standard and wanting to adopt the Arches Platform. Ogee Arches takes the difficulty out of starting a Linked.art compatible data project using Arches by providing the complete set of models envisioned by Linked.art and setting them up in a ready to use fashion in the Arches Platform.

Ogee Arches is intended to be used internally at Getty Digital as a starting point for data modelling projects where it can be extended or pruned in order to meet the needs of the data project in question. Getty Digital, moreover, offers the package together with Takin.solutions as an open source resource for any institution or individual to adopt as a way to kick start their semantic data projects.
