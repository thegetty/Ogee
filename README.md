# Ogee
Ogee Arches is a package designed for the Arches platform that implements the Linked.art data model (as recorded on the web, December 2023), provides a complete vocabulary to support that data model and is fully documented with reusable documentation.

Ogee Arches has been created by Getty Digital with the support of Takin.solutions. Its primary aim is to serve as a starter Arches package for projects aiming to use the Linked.art standard and wanting to adopt the Arches Platform. Ogee Arches takes the difficulty out of starting a Linked.art compatible data project using Arches by providing the complete set of models envisioned by Linked.art and setting them up in a ready to use fashion in the Arches Platform.

Ogee Arches is intended to be used internally at Getty Digital as a starting point for data modelling projects where it can be extended or pruned in order to meet the needs of the data project in question. Getty Digital, moreover, offers the package together with Takin.solutions as an open source resource for any institution or individual to adopt as a way to kick start their semantic data projects.

Note: 
Models are current to the Linked.Art website documentation as of December 2023. Though changes to the Linked.Art schema has and will continue to occur as the community builds towards a 1.0 version of Linked.Art, these models are not guranteed to be updated in tandem.
